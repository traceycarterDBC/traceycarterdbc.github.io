  <h1>Survival of the Fittest Code</h1>
  <h2>Git and Github</h2>

        <p>Version control means the ability to go back in time to any point at which a file was saved or tracked. Git is the version control system. It tracks the changes every time a developer saves or, in git language, commits them. If something bad happens to a file, such as an experiment that just did not work as you thought it would, you can go back to the point in time right before you made that experimental change, and exist as if you had never made that mistake, a.k.a. learning experience. Wouldn't it be grand if life had version control, allowing us to experiment and make mistakes while avoiding living with the consequences of said mistake by jumping back to the moment before you made the mistake? Obviously, it would be friggin grand! </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The great thing about using Github is that you open up your code and all its possibilities to the huge community of developers on Github. Because Github stuff is open source, anyone from the Github community has access to your code. They can use it, modify it, distribute it to others (who can then use or modify it). This means that we, as a community, can make mistakes (have learning experiences) together and improve code with exponential speed. Putting many heads together allows us to draw on the creative and skillful ability of the entire dev community. Like a virus, code can grow in nearly infinite new strains rapidly with the inferior code being constantly replaced by smoother, less buggy code. It's like "survival of the fittest" code... but faster than organic evolution.</p>
