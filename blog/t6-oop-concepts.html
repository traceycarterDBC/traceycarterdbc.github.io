  <h1>Object-Oriented Programming vs. Functional Programming</h1>
  <h4>Sunday, June 7, 2015</h4><br>
  </div>

  <div id="text">
        <h1>In the Abstract</h1>
        <p>Ruby is an object-oriented language. The benefits of object-oriented programming include the ability for a program to grow and transform over time, adapting to the ever-changing needs of the programmers and goals of the program.</p>

        <p>The biggest difference between object-oriented programming and functional programming is the perspective from which actions are accomplished. Both are very "action-oriented." Something happens. Something changes. In functional programming, the basis of making things happen is the set of predefined procedures - the action. In object-oriented programming, the basis of making things happen is the object itself. Objects have certain behaviors or tendencies. These are all clearly defined by an objects methods. We can see functional programming as based on the verb or the action, whereas object-oriented programming is based on the noun, the subject that takes the action or the object on which the action is performed.</p>

        <p>Because functional programming is based on the functions or verbs, the data in functional programming is only loosely coupled with the functions. The functions, not the data, rule the language and the programs. In object-oriented programming, on the other hand, the data and operations are very tightly coupled. Each object or type of object (class) has its own data, its own behavior, and a particular way of interacting with other objects. The advantage to being object-oriented is that when changes must be made, only the objects that will need to know about the changes will know, but those that do not need to know about the changes can be insulated so that they are unaffected,happily continuing to behave in their normal ways despite the drastic changes that have affected some other objects. </p>

        <h1>Literal, Human-World Example</h1>
        <p>Let's put this in more literal, human terms to make it easier to understand. People live in families and communities and interact with each other. That is just what they do. The same can be said for the elements of programs - the functions or objects. Because things change naturally, we must consider how we will deal with changes when they come. If the actions all change, then the change affects everybody. For example, a recent issue that has changed in U.S. social and political life is marriage equality. If we were living in a functional world, that change would affect everybody. Every person would change in some way by the recent ruling by the Supreme Court. Everyone would have to get married to someone of the same gender or else have their heterosexual marriage be directly impacted by the fact that some other people were doing this. In an object-oriented world, only those objects whose fates were closely tied to the change would be affected. So, gay and lesbian people would marry people of the same gender, but heterosexual people, separate objects entirely, would go on living the same way they were before the ruling. Changes would be happening around them and may affect other people (objects) who are in their environment, but they would pretty much still be straight people marrying other straight people, no big deal. Only the people (objects) who need to be affected are affected. The rest continue doing their own thing.</p>

      <p>As our human-world example shows, object-oriented programming facilitates the ability to deal with change without massive disruption of the entire environment in which every single piece of data in an environment changes when a large, all-encompassing function changes. Functional programming should, therefore, be used on things that are unlikely to change but are subject to being operated on by a changing group of identities. Things that change often, on the other hand, should probably be written in an object-oriented language. Because change comes frequently and dramatically in today's world, object-oriented programming is extremely advantageous. Where interests come into conflict due to massive frequent changes, it is probably best to go with the "to each her own" approach.
