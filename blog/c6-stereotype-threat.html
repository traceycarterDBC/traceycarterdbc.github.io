  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h4>Sunday, June 7, 2015</h4><br>

  <div id="text">
        <h1></h1>
        <p>Most people live with some level of fear or anxiety about the stereotypes society has about identity groups of which they are members. This anxiety or consciousness of the stereotype is more pronounced in some groups than others with those having the highest degree of the most negative kinds of stereotypes being the most fearful or anxious of "living up to" and therefore reinforcing the negative stereotypes. </p>

        <p>I am familiar with the anxiety that can accompany this fear of living up to the stereotypes of one's social identity. There are stereotypes of black people, women, and gay or lesbian individuals that I must contend with, though the older I get, the less I care what others think. I would say that, of these, the greatest impact on me has been overcoming the stereotyping of women. Being light-skinned lessens the impact on me personally of stereotype threat associated with the African American community, although I can definitely relate to people who are more intensely affected by it. And being a feminine-presenting queer person, I don't face the most cruel and insensitive reactions from society, including stereotypes put on my LGBT community. However, being female has, more than anything else, affected my ability to compete in the economy invarious different careers I have tried. With a PhD in history in hand, I was overlooked multiple times for tenure track professor positions when they realized that I was a mother. I can offer many examples in totally different areas where being a woman, one is just taken less seriously than men.</p>

        <p>The reason I chose this topic is that Dev Bootcamp is my first significant attempt to stamp out this fear of being taken less seriously due to my gender. I loved algebra in school. I was told by high school chemistry and physics teachers that their subjects were just not really good choices for girls. (I not only took them but forced myself to study enough to get an A in chemistry and B+ in physics.) However, in the end, I would say that stereotype threat did determine the direction I went after graduating college. I became an educator and later a technical writer. After college, I taught elementary school and many years later was an adjunct professor teaching undergraduate history courses. I spent a few years doing technical writing at PeopleSoft, Plumtree Software, and several other companies for short-term contracts around the Bay Area. But tech writing was the closest I ever came to overcoming stereotype threat for my gender. I was always curious about computer languages but had a feeling that it was something I might not be good at compared to men or even more masculine presenting women. Crazy, right? So DBC is the choice I finally made to purposefully do something I've always had an interest in but that I thought was simply not for me as a woman. Whatever happens, I will overcome my fear of being judged poorly for being in a "man's field." I have noticed in many jobs (in which I was a tech writer or Instructional Designer) that men always dominate the developer positions. I have also noticed, even in DBC pairings, that men do project a much greater amount of confidence than women despite having pretty much the same level of expertise. We need to fix this. Women need to present as confidently and assertively as men do. Once I have become a developer, I plan to do everything I can to make the field more accessible to as many women as possible. We have a long way to go here, but it starts with me graduating DBC and being an example and an advocate for other women to go into technology. </p>
