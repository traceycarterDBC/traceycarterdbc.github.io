  <h1>Pairing and Feedback</h1>

        <h1>Pairing</h1>
       

        <p>Pairing is, itself, a challenge for me as I find it harder to think on the spot when others are watching me and waiting for my response. I do like discussing the possible ways to solve problems along the way to finishing the challenge. I like getting others' input and discussing my own thoughts on how to approach the challenge. The frustrating or difficult part is just having to stay calm and give myself the time to think it through when I know somebody is waiting for a quick response. I guess I find it harder to take risks on both navigating and typing in the code when someone is watching.</p>

        <p>I enjoyed reading the feedback and found much of it helpful. Based on the feedback I received, I think it is a good idea for me to read through the challenges thoroughly and develop at least a partial potential solution (at least the pseudocode) before our appointment to actually chat about it. More than one past pair recommended that I do that because I seemed nervous to take initiative when on the call.</p>
        <p>I enjoyed giving the feedback, as well. The most difficult thing is, of course, voicing a criticism and making sure that it is a constructive criticism. One benefit of giving feedback is that I sometimes find myself saying something about a partner and, upon hearing it, realize that I do the same thing. Then, I can take my own advice, as it were. It is often easier to see a habit or dynamic among others than in oneself. I like the pairing and feedback, however, I feel it will be even more useful when we have all covered the basics. Often times, neither of the two in the pair really have any idea of how to approach something. I have really appreciated it when some of the guides (not all guides do this, though) will jump into the conversation at just the right moment and offer useful guidance. I prefer the more hands-on guides at this point. When we are all a bit more experienced, or have at least mastered the fundamentals, it will be easier to help each other out. I appreciate the sense of being in a learning community that is fostered by the pairing and the feedback.</p>
