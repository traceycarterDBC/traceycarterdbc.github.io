  <h1>Dealing with Conflict</h1>

        <p>One conflict I faced was the disruption of my peace and quiet in my apartment due to my building renovating. My apartment was right next to the main area being renovated, so daily I had to deal with extremely loud construction noise, including a jackhammer that gave me a headache and left me unable to work. Because I was in a work-from-home job, the noise disrupted my workspace as well as my living space. I was a content developer for an educational software company, a job that required a great deal of focus. I am the kind of person who needs absolute quiet to really focus and make efficient progress. </p>
        <p>For a few days, I did nothing except get more and more angry. By the end of the first week, I spoke to the building manager about the problem, explaining that I needed quiet during the day to do my job. There was nothing that management could do about it. To make matters worse, we lost electricity in about 85% of our apartment when construction hit a place where our apartment's wiring connected to the rest of the building. At that point, management had to do something or face legal a legal dispute. We had electricity only in our kitchen and nowhere else in the apartment. Again, with a work-from-home that relied on internet access, this made my life extremely difficult.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, I continued speaking to the management about the problem, and the landlord bought us very expensive lanterns to use in all of the rooms that had no electricity. Then, we were able to move into a different apartment in the same building since they could not figure out the electrical problem. We also got about two months of free rent. While I had purchased the URL of the name of our apartment building from godaddy.com (and planned to organize other tenants with complaints to publicize the problems of the building), I ultimately found that this was too confrontational and stressed me out. I was somewhat satisfied with the outcome, especially since we did not have to pay rent for two months. I think the main problem was that it was about more than money to me. I felt disrespected by the building management and owners because I really don't think they would have tolerated living that way, themselves. I felt that they thought that my family was somehow not deserving of a minimum level of housing accommodations. Now that the construction (which drug on for about six months) is complete and we have electricity, I am glad that I did not let my anger get the best of me. We ended up with a better apartment and still have relatively good rent and other conveniences of the building. However, I do still own the URL with the building's name should things ever get out of hand again.</p>
