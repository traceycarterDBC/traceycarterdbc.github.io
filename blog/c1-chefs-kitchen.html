        <p>    I like the fact that DBC encourages people to take ownership of the experience and have to confidence to experiment, try, fail, and learn. This is how any true learning takes place. I support the position that Shereef takes in the video because it is the best approach to actually gaining expertise and not just posing as smart or savvy. I want to learn and look forward to the opportunity to take charge of my own learning. This has been my experience as a teacher. You learn by diving in. I was terrified the first time I taught at UC Berkeley and USF. I taught African history to undergraduates and had not been out of my own program long. I was not an old, knowledgeable professor. I was a new one learning the ropes. I learned that you just have to dive in without reservations and admit what you don't know, learn it, then teach it. Teaching is the best way to learn. I love the fact that it sounds like we will all be teaching as well as learning. I feel very comfortable with communities that progress together as a community. The U.S. in general could learn from this model. We rise and fail together. I am, of course, quite nervous because I do not have a computer science background. However, I am excited to finally be challenged again. It has been a long time now since I had to learn something totally new and challenging. I did not know that DBC really even had a culture. I figured that, like most American companies, it was just a place where people exchange goods and services and the ultimate goal is to make money. I have been disillusioned by this throughout my life and hope to continue finding communities that have higher motivations - the progress of everyone over the privilege of a few. So, I have been really happy to learn more about DBC's philosophy. Now I know I made the right decision. It sounds like the kind of place that will allow growth for all of us.
