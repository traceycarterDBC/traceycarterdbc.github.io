  <h1>Thinking Style</h1>
  <h4>Friday, May 17, 2015</h4><br>

  <div id="text">
        <p>According to the Gregorc Thinking Style article, I am an "abstract random" thinker. I am an auditory learner who thinks conceptually, not in a granular way. I am actually a mix of conceptual/abstract and factual/granular. I do like to memorize things, such as formulas, commands, and languages in general - both human and computer languages. It helps me to discuss the concepts or even say them aloud. I talk myself through solving problems, whether it is aloud or in my head. I am very verbal (though not an extrovert, so most of the discussion goes on in my head).</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In terms of the concept of growth vs. fixed mindset, I believe I am more growth-oriented. In fact, I have switched careers many times because when I hit my plateau for learning new things, I get very bored and want to do something completely different so that I can stimulate my mind with having to learn new things again. Like everyone else, I was raised to be more of a fixed mindset. That is to say, I was raised to value accumulating information until reaching an expert level and then just staying there and advising people who don't know as much. However, I find that extremely boring. I like having to not only learn new things, but think in new ways. I have been extremely stimulated by getting to do this since starting Dev Bootcamp. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>To best use my thinking style in the service of learning software development, I think it will help me to verbalize everything I am doing in the steps I take toward solving problems or writing code. I enjoy the pseudocode portion of the exercises. I definitely talk aloud or to myself to explain what has to happen next in each step towards solving challenges. My growth-oriented mindset should actually help in learning new systems, new languages, and new ways of thinking required to code.</p>
