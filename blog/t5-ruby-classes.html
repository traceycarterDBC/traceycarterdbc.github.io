  <h1>Ruby Classes</h1>
  <h4>Sunday, May 30, 2015</h4><br>
  </div>

  <div id="text">
        <p>A Ruby class is a category of objects. The objects of a class are all members that have certain aspects in common but, specifically, the details are different. The best way to understand this is by comparing it to a category in the natural world. A class is akin to a species. For example, while we are all Homo sapiens sapiens, we are not all the same person. Oprah Winfrey and Mahatma Gandhi, both Homo sapiens sapiens, are extremely different from each other. They differ in gender, nationality, generation, and many other ways. However, Oprah Winfrey and Mahatma Gandhi are much more alike than either is to an animal of a different species. Classes exist so that we can collect, execute methods on, and define instances within that class. Using our metaphor, the Homo sapiens sapiens class, a.k.a. humans, has to exist in order to think about them all at once. </p>
        
        <p>If we want to solve the problem of bringing clean water to millions of people in West Africa, we must discuss them as a group in order to do the planning. Those in one village must communicate with and work together on projects with those in another area to build necessary infrastructure to bring water to all of their homes. They must get the resources from somewhere and manipulate those resources in certain ways, to build the final aquaduct project that will solve the problem of providing water to the homes of millions of people. We will use this example to explain the various Ruby objects. The ultimate goal in our example is to provide water to millions of people. That would be the goal and output of a Ruby program.</p>
        <h1>Instances of a Class</h1>
        <p>In this example, the class is homes in West Africa. An instance of the class would be one home into which water must be pumped. 
        <h1>Methods</h1>
        <p>In the example above, the actions which must be executed along the way to achieving the ultimate goal are the equivalent of methods. A method might be transporting the materials required to mix cement. Another method might be actually mixing the cement which relies on human or material labor. The labor would be the method, while the materials needed would be the variables.
