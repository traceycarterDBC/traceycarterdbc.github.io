  <h1>Gender Issues in Tech</h1>
  <h4>Sunday, May 17, 2015</h4><br>
  </div>

  <div id="text">
        <p>One of the biggest challenges in the tech industry is maintaining a diverse pool of developers. As in any field, the bigger and more diverse the talent pool, the richer the resource pool for building and maintaining projects. More diverse employee pools also leads to more innovation as people with many different life experiences, unique skills, and preferences will have many more perspectives on the best or most innovative ways to solve problems, or even to determine which problems are the ones that, if solved, would lead to the greatest progress. </p>

         <h1>Access</h1>
        <p>Because access to technology and training varies so widely from one community to another, the skills required to become a good developer are found in pockets rather than spread widely across all segments of the population. This is primarily due to the expense of making technology available. However, there is evidence that even when women have access to technology and training, there is still a lower rate of retention within the tech industry for women than for men.</p>

        <h1>Retention</h1>
        <p>Many reasons may account for women remaining in the tech industry less so than their male counterparts. A brief search of the topic uncovers issue such as earning lower salaries for the same positions (on par with pretty much all other industries), a lack of flexibility with hours and time off that many women need because of family obligations (again, this is not unique to technology), and the so-called "bro-grammer culture" found in the tech industry. This last point is something that the tech industry has in common with other sectors that have been traditionally male, such as welders (there's a reason you remember "Rosie the Riveter") or professional football players. What can the tech industry do to keep the women who know how to code and complete major projects? Paying women the same salaries that their male counterparts earn is quite obviously the best starting place. Hiring or promoting women into leadership positions would help change the overall culture of the tech industry in a way that would not only help women to maintain long-term careers in tech, but also modify the existing culture of the industry in ways that would be healthy for all employees.
